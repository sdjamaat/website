# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## FMB Database Year Logic

- For FMB menus, always use `getHijriDate().databaseYear` instead of `getHijriDate().year` when querying Firestore collections
- Moharram menus are stored in the previous Hijri year's collection (e.g., Moharram 1447 is stored under year 1446)
- This is because Moharram menus are created during Zil Haj of the previous year
- The DateContext provides both `year` (actual Hijri year) and `databaseYear` (correct year for database queries)

## Sharp Module Issues

- If you get "Cannot find module '../build/Release/sharp.node'" error when running Gatsby, run `npm rebuild --verbose sharp`
- The project uses gatsby-image and childImageSharp for image optimization in navbar, layout, committees, and welcome-about components
- Sharp is required and cannot be removed - it's essential for Gatsby's image processing features

## Current Task: Fix Safar 1447 Menu Display Issue

### Problem:

Safar 1447 menu is active in the database but not showing up on the user portal.

### Analysis Plan:

[X] Investigate DateContext implementation to understand year vs databaseYear logic
[X] Check how menus are queried in the FMB components
[X] Identify where the bug is occurring (likely using wrong year for queries)
[X] Fix the query to use databaseYear instead of year
[X] Test the fix to ensure Safar 1447 menus appear

### Bug Found & Analysis:

**Issue 1 (FIXED):** In `view-selections.tsx` line 32 - was using `year` instead of `databaseYear`

**Issue 2 (FIXED):** Cross-year transition logic missing in `submit-menu.js`

- **WAS**: Only checking current databaseYear (1446) collection
- **ISSUE**: Safar 1447 active in 1447 collection, but component only looked at 1446
- **FIXED**: Added fallback logic to check actual year collection when in Moharram and no active menu found in databaseYear

**Issue 3 (FIXED):** State not properly reset for new menus

- **WAS**: `hasAlreadySubmitted` and `alreadySubmittedItemsDoc` not reset when loading new menu
- **ISSUE**: Showing old submission data from previous menus when loading Safar 1447
- **FIXED**: Added state reset logic before checking submissions for any new menu

**Issue 4 (FIXED):** Submission saving to wrong database collection

- **WAS**: Submission function using `databaseYear` (1446) for all submissions
- **ISSUE**: Safar 1447 menu loads from 1447 collection but submissions tried to save to 1446 collection
- **FIXED**: Added `activeMenuYear` state to track which year collection the active menu came from, use that for submissions

### Status: Complete ✅

All four issues have been fixed:

1. `view-selections.tsx` now uses correct `databaseYear`
2. `submit-menu.js` now handles cross-year transitions for Moharram → other months
3. Component state properly resets when loading new menus
4. Submissions now save to the correct database collection matching where the menu was loaded from

Users should now be able to fully view and submit Safar 1447 menus successfully.

### Notes:

From lessons learned: Safar is the 2nd month of Hijri calendar. The DateContext provides both `year` (actual Hijri year) and `databaseYear` (correct year for database queries). Always use `databaseYear` for Firestore collection queries in FMB components.
